Code was written in Anaconda Spyder environment. Running the code directly will give the results.
It creates 3 n-gram language model for n = 1, 2, 3
Then for each n value 
	it prints out the perplexity score of sprob and if n > 2 linear interpolation and discounting of given test file.
	After that, it generates 5 sentences and prints out the probability of this generated sentences.
